Here's a refined solution breakdown based on your diagnosis and steps:

### **Diagnosis:**

The build failure is due to a missing or incompatible native build for the `lmdb` module on the specified platform (Linux x64) and Node.js version (19.8.1).

### **Solution Steps:**

1. **Switch to a Compatible Node.js Version:**

   - The error may be due to the specific Node.js version (19.8.1) not being compatible with the current native module builds. It is generally safer to use an LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js for better compatibility.
   - Switch to a Node.js version that is commonly supported by most libraries, such as **Node.js v18.x**.
   - You can specify the Node version in your project by creating a `.nvmrc` file or updating the `package.json` file:

   ```bash
   # .nvmrc
   18.17.0
   ```

   Or in `package.json`:

   ```json
   "engines": {
     "node": "18.x"
   }
   ```

2. **Update npm Version:**

   - Ensure that the npm version matches the compatible Node.js version. If you are downgrading Node.js to v18.x, ensure you are using a compatible npm version:

   ```bash
   npm install -g npm@latest
   ```

3. **Reinstall Project Dependencies:**

   - Clean up any existing dependencies and reinstall them to ensure native modules are correctly built for the current platform and architecture:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

   This will ensure that all dependencies, including native modules, are rebuilt correctly for the environment.

4. **Clear Netlify Cache and Redeploy:**

   - Sometimes, a lingering cache can cause issues. Clear the cache on Netlify and redeploy the site:

   - Go to **Netlify Dashboard** > **Deploys** > **Trigger Deploy** > **Clear cache and deploy site**.

5. **Check for Required Build Tools:**

   - Ensure all necessary build tools are available. For native modules, `node-gyp` and associated build tools are needed. If they are missing, install them using:

   ```bash
   npm install -g node-gyp
   ```

6. **Investigate Further into Native Module Dependencies:**

   - If the issue persists, check if the `@lmdb/lmdb` module or any other native dependencies have specific instructions or known issues with the current environment.
   - Look into the GitHub repository or documentation for any environment-specific setup or build issues.

7. **Build from Source:**

   - If `@lmdb/lmdb` or any native dependency is still causing issues, try forcing a rebuild:

   ```bash
   npm rebuild @lmdb/lmdb --build-from-source
   ```

### **Conclusion:**

By switching to a stable Node.js version, ensuring all dependencies are correctly installed, and clearing caches, you should be able to resolve the native build error on Netlify and successfully deploy your project.
