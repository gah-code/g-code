life: "From a young age I was influenced by art, design, and graffiti culture, starting with PC games like RollerCoaster Tycoon, later venturing into customizing MySpace pages themed after the rock music I loved. In my journey, I picked up photography, capturing weddings and martial arts events as a freelancer. This need to showcase my work led me to discover the world of web development."
