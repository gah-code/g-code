life: "As a kid, I had a passion for art and design, influenced by my love for PC games and comic books. I later ventured into customizing MySpace pages and explored interests like graffiti and skating. In my journey, I picked up photography, capturing weddings and martial arts events as a freelancer. This need to showcase my work led me to discover the world of web development."
