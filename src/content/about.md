life: "From a young age I was influenced by art and design, starting with PC games, music, and comic books. I later ventured into customizing MySpace pages and explored interests like graffiti and skating. In my journey, I picked up photography, capturing weddings and martial arts events as a freelancer. This need to showcase my work led me to discover the world of web development."
